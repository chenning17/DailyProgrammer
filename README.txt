This project holds my attempts to solve a range of problems on the Daily Programmer thread on reddit.

So far I have attempted the following problems:
    -> Challenge #328 [Easy] Latin Squares
       https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/6v29zk/170821_challenge_328_easy_latin_squares/
       -> basic challenge completed (not attempted bonus yet)
