This project holds my attempts to solve a range of problems on the Daily Programmer thread on reddit.

So far I have attempted the following problems:
    -> Challenge #328 [Easy] Latin Squares
       https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/6v29zk/170821_challenge_328_easy_latin_squares/
       -> basic challenge completed (not attempted bonus yet)
       
    -> Challenge #323 [Easy] 3SUM
       https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/6melen/20170710_challenge_323_easy_3sum/
       -> challenge completed minus the fact that repeat solutions are printed out
          so it technically doesn't match outputs expected on website, however I 
          believe that these are also valid solutions since the input values are 
          actually repeated so they have been treated here as being separate solutions.
       -> the method used to solve this is a bit messy and could definitely be cleaned up,
          however it is necessary to point out that it is more efficient than a brute force
          check all possible combinations method.
